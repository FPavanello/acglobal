# Description
This repository provides the codes required to reproduce the tables, figures, and in-text summary statistics in De Cian et al. (mimeo). 

## Folders

 - `rscript/` - contains all R codes that replicates tables and figures in the paper
 - `output/` - where all results are stored

## Data for replications
The data used in the paper are available for download in the following repository: [Link]()

## Steps

In the `rscript/` folder the analysis is conducted following **seven** steps:

1. **Descriptives** - code to produce the descriptive analysis in the paper (Table 1, Table 2, Figure 1)
2. **Main** - code to produce the main specification of the paper (Table 3, Figure 2, Table A1, Table A2)
3. **Heterogeneity** - code to produce the heterogeneity analysis in the paper, based on income quintiles and country-level (Figure 3, Figure 4, Table A5)
4. **Standardised** - code to produce the country-specific standardised regressions and the descriptive meta-analysis of the coefficients (Figure 5, Figure A1)
6. **Additional analysis** - code to produce auxiliary analysis with: (a) solar PV generation (Table 5, Table A11-A14), (b) other appliances (Table A6-A9)
5. **Robustness** - code to produce the robustness checks (Table A3, Table A4)
7. **Projections** - code to produce the projections and the relative analysis (Table 4, Figure A3, Figure A4, Table A10)
8. **Implications** - code to produce the 'implications' results: budget share, distribution of electricity consumption, energy supply, and CO2 emissions (Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure A2, Table A15)
9. **Supplementary** - code to produce Supplementary Information results (Table S1-S18, Figure S1-S7)
